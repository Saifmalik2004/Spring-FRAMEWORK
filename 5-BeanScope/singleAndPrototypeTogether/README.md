### ‚òï **Singleton vs Prototype: Understanding with a Coffee Shop Example**  

Let's say you own a **coffee shop**. Some things are **shared by everyone**, while others are **unique for each customer**.  

- **‚òï Coffee Machine (Singleton)** ‚Üí The shop has **one** coffee machine that all baristas use.  
- **ü•§ Coffee Cup (Prototype)** ‚Üí Every customer gets a **new cup** for their coffee.  

---

## üè™ **Real-Life Analogy**  

- When a customer **orders coffee**, the **coffee machine** (Singleton) makes coffee.  
- Each customer gets a **new coffee cup** (Prototype) for their order.  
- The machine should **always give a fresh cup**, not reuse old ones!  

---

## üõ† **Implementing in Spring**  

### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Singleton Bean (CoffeeMachine)**
The **coffee machine** is shared by everyone, so it should be a Singleton.  

```java
@Component
public class CoffeeMachine {
    public void brewCoffee() {
        System.out.println("Brewing coffee...");
    }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Prototype Bean (CoffeeCup)**
Every time a customer orders, they should get a **new coffee cup**.  

```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype") // Creates a new instance each time
public class CoffeeCup {
    private final String id;

    public CoffeeCup() {
        this.id = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        System.out.println("New CoffeeCup Created: " + id);
    }

    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }
}
```

---

### ‚ùå **Wrong Way: Injecting Prototype into Singleton**
If we **directly inject** `CoffeeCup` into `CoffeeShop`, Spring **creates only one cup** and reuses it for all orders!  

```java
@Component
public class CoffeeShop {
    private final CoffeeMachine coffeeMachine;
    private final CoffeeCup coffeeCup; // ‚ùå Wrong! Only one instance is created!

    @Autowired
    public CoffeeShop(CoffeeMachine coffeeMachine, CoffeeCup coffeeCup) {
        this.coffeeMachine = coffeeMachine;
        this.coffeeCup = coffeeCup;
    }

    public CoffeeCup serveCoffee() {
        coffeeMachine.brewCoffee();
        return coffeeCup; // ‚ùå Returns the same cup every time!
    }
}
```
üìå **Problem:** Every customer gets the **same coffee cup**, which is wrong!  

---

### ‚úÖ **Correct Way: Using ObjectFactory to Get a New Cup Each Time**  
Instead of injecting a single `CoffeeCup`, we use a **factory method** to create a **new cup every time**.  

```java
@Component
public class CoffeeShop {
    private final CoffeeMachine coffeeMachine;
    
    @Autowired
    private ObjectFactory<CoffeeCup> coffeeCupFactory; // Factory to create new instances

    @Autowired
    public CoffeeShop(CoffeeMachine coffeeMachine) {
        this.coffeeMachine = coffeeMachine;
    }

    public CoffeeCup serveCoffee() {
        coffeeMachine.brewCoffee();
        return coffeeCupFactory.getObject(); // ‚úÖ New cup each time
    }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Testing the Application**  
```java
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
CoffeeShop shop = context.getBean(CoffeeShop.class);

CoffeeCup order1 = shop.serveCoffee();
CoffeeCup order2 = shop.serveCoffee();

System.out.println(order1.getId()); // Different IDs
System.out.println(order2.getId()); // Different IDs
System.out.println(order1 == order2); // false (Different objects)
```
üìå **Now, every customer gets a fresh cup!** üéâ

## üéØ **Key Takeaways**
| Feature  | Singleton (Coffee Machine) | Prototype (Coffee Cup) |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Instances Created** | One for the whole application | New instance every request |
| **Best Use Case** | Shared resources (e.g., database connection) | Independent, stateful objects |
| **Injection Behavior** | Same instance is injected everywhere | New instance is created every time |

### **When to Use?**
‚úÖ Use **Singleton** when you need **shared instances** (like database connections).  
‚úÖ Use **Prototype** when you need **new instances every time** (like user input, temporary objects).  

---

Now, your coffee shop serves **fresh cups** to every customer while keeping **one shared coffee machine**! ‚òïü•§
