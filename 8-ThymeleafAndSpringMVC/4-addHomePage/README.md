# 🚀 **Adding a Home Page to Our Website – Education Hub**  

## 🎯 **Introduction**  
Now that we have set up our **Spring Boot project** and are familiar with **Spring DevTools**, it's time to **accelerate our development** and take things to the **next level**! 🚀  

In this phase, we are going to **enhance our project** by adding a **Home Page** to our **Education Hub** website. Instead of writing all the content from scratch, we will **source some static content** from a **website that provides free templates and resources**. This will help us **speed up development** and focus on integrating it into our Spring Boot project.

## 🏗️ **What Are We Adding?**  
To make our **Education Hub** look more **professional and visually appealing**, we are adding:  
✅ A **home.html** page with content sourced from a template.  
✅ A **static assets folder** to store images, JavaScript, CSS, and fonts.  
✅ A well-structured **project directory** to manage frontend resources efficiently.

## 📂 **Project Structure Update**  

We will create a new **assets folder** inside `src/main/resources/static/` to store our frontend resources:  

```

│── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   ├── resources/
│   │   │   ├── templates/

│   │   │   │   │   ├── images/ 👈 (Images used in the project)
│   │   │   │   │   ├── webfonts/ 👈 (Fonts to beautify our website)
```

### 📌 **What’s Inside Each Folder?**
