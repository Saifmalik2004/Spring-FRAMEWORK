# Introduction to Wiring and Autowiring in Spring

## 🌱 What is Wiring in Spring?
Wiring in Spring refers to the process of connecting components (beans) in a Spring application. It enables objects to work together by injecting dependencies, ensuring that classes get the required objects without explicitly instantiating them.

### 🔍 Why Do We Need Wiring?
In a large application, manually creating and managing dependencies becomes complex and unmanageable. Wiring helps achieve:
- **Loose Coupling** – Components interact through interfaces, making the application modular.
- **Scalability** – Dependency injection (DI) enables better maintainability and testing.
- **Flexibility** – Swapping implementations without modifying dependent classes.

## 🚨 Scenario Without Wiring
Let's consider a simple example where an application requires a `Car` object that depends on an `Engine`.

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine(); // Direct instantiation (tight coupling)
    }
    
    void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.drive();
    }
}
```

### ❌ Problems with This Approach
- **Tightly Coupled:** `Car` is dependent on a specific `Engine` implementation.
- **Difficult to Test:** Cannot easily swap `Engine` for a mock or a different type.
- **Hard to Maintain:** Changes in `Engine` require modifying `Car`.

## ⚡ What is Autowiring in Spring?
**Autowiring** is the automatic injection of dependencies into beans by Spring’s IoC container, removing the need for explicit bean configuration.

### 🎯 Benefits of Autowiring
✔ **Loose Coupling** – The `Car` class no longer creates an `Engine` object.
✔ **Testability** – We can now mock `Engine` easily.
✔ **Easier Maintenance** – Any implementation of `Engine` can be injected without modifying `Car`.

## 📌 Summary
Spring Wiring and Autowiring help in making applications more modular, testable, and maintainable by reducing tight coupling and manual dependency management. In the next README, we will explore different ways to implement Wiring in Spring. 🚀
