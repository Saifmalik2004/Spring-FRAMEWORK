# 🌱 Spring Core - The Heart of the Spring Framework

## 🚀 Introduction: What is Spring Core?
Spring Core is the **foundation** of the entire Spring Framework. Every Spring project, whether it's **Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security, or Spring Data**, is built on top of Spring Core! Without understanding **Spring Core**, mastering the Spring Framework is impossible. 😎

So, what does **Spring Core** do? 🤔

It provides the essential features that make Spring so powerful, including:
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)** 🛠️ - Spring takes care of object creation & management so you don't have to!
- **Dependency Injection (DI)** 🔗 - Helps in reducing tight coupling between objects.
- **Beans & ApplicationContext** 🫘 - The backbone of Spring applications.
- **IoC Container** 📦 - The magical container that manages Spring beans.
- **Spring Expression Language (SpEL)** 📝 - A way to dynamically access and manipulate objects at runtime.

In this section of the repository, we will dive deep into **each** of these concepts, one by one, in their own individual README files. 📚✨

## 🔥 Why is Spring Core Important?

Imagine you're building a huge application. Without Spring Core:
- You'd have to manually create and manage **all objects** in your application (😩 messy and complex!).
- Dependencies between components would be **hardcoded**, making code difficult to maintain.
- Configuring applications would be a nightmare. 😱

Spring Core **solves** these problems by providing a structured way to manage objects, dependencies, and configurations. It acts like a **smart manager** who organizes everything efficiently. 💡

## 🏗️ Key Components of Spring Core

### 1️⃣ **Inversion of Control (IoC)** 🔄
IoC means Spring **controls** the object lifecycle instead of you manually creating objects. It ensures better **scalability** and **maintainability**.

🔍 Example:
```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;
    
    public Car(Engine engine) { // IoC - Spring injects this!
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
Spring **injects the dependencies**, so we don’t have to manually create them. 🚀

---

### 2️⃣ **Dependency Injection (DI)** 💉
Dependency Injection is a way to pass dependencies to a class instead of letting it create them itself. This promotes **loose coupling** and makes our code more **flexible**.

🔍 Example:
```java
@Component
class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started!");
    }
}

@Component
class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) { // DI - Injecting Engine automatically!
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```
Now, Spring automatically injects an `Engine` instance into `Car`. No manual object creation required! 🏎️

---

### 3️⃣ **Beans & ApplicationContext** 🫘
A **Bean** is just a normal Java object that Spring manages. `ApplicationContext` is the **brain** 🧠 of the Spring application, managing all Beans.

🔍 Example:
```java
@Configuration
class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public Car car() {
        return new Car(new Engine());
    }
}
```
Spring will **automatically create** and manage this `Car` bean. Easy, right? 😃

---

### 4️⃣ **IoC Container** 📦
Spring's **IoC Container** is responsible for managing the lifecycle of Beans. It loads bean definitions, resolves dependencies, and injects them wherever needed. The two types are:
1. **BeanFactory** - Lightweight container, used for simple applications.
2. **ApplicationContext** - More powerful, used in most Spring applications.

---

### 5️⃣ **Spring Expression Language (SpEL)** 📝
Spring Expression Language allows you to work with objects dynamically using expressions. You can retrieve data, invoke methods, and even perform calculations at runtime!

🔍 Example:
```java
@Value("#{2 + 3}") // SpEL evaluates this at runtime!
private int sum;
```
Here, `sum` will be automatically set to `5` when the application runs! 🔢
